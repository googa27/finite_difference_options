# IMPERATIVE COMMANDS, MUST FOLLOW

I will write imperative commands that you MUST follow. No option not to follow them. These commands are always preceded by a star sybol (*). The commands are the following:


- *read_only_mode : when this command is written by the user in the CLI, it means that the user is in read only mode, you are not allowed to write any files.
- *default_mode : when this command is written by the user in the CLI, it means that you are in default mode. No specific instructions apply in default mode. When starting, you are in default mode.
- Each mode is exclusive, meaning that you can only be in one mode at a time. If you are in plan mode, you cannot be in write mode or review mode, and vice versa.
- *mode : when this command is written by the user in the CLI, you must print the current mode.
