## Task Description
Implement all refactoring opportunities to improve code organization and eliminate redundancy in the src directory structure. This involves consolidating legacy and new architecture, unifying instrument hierarchies, and creating a more cohesive and maintainable codebase.

## Detailed Requirements
1. Eliminate redundancy between legacy and new architecture
2. Consolidate instrument hierarchies into a unified model
3. Unify PDE solving components into a cohesive interface
4. Centralize boundary condition handling across all dimensions
5. Enhance process model organization for extensibility
6. Improve multi-dimensional support for simplified usage
7. Strengthen validation and error handling systems
8. Refactor plotting and visualization components
9. Optimize risk and Greeks calculation
10. Create configuration management system

## Implementation Approach
1. Start by analyzing current file structure and dependencies
2. Create backup of current implementation
3. Implement refactors incrementally, one at a time
4. Test each refactor thoroughly before moving to the next
5. Update documentation and examples as needed
6. Remove deprecated files and code after successful migration

## Files to Modify
- `src/__init__.py`: Update exports for new structure
- `src/boundary_conditions.py`: Consolidate with new boundary condition system
- `src/exceptions.py`: Enhance with domain-specific exceptions
- `src/greeks.py`: Integrate with unified risk calculation
- `src/instruments.py`: Consolidate with pricing/instruments/
- `src/models.py`: Update to use new process system
- `src/multidimensional_boundary_conditions.py`: Merge with boundary condition system
- `src/multidimensional_pricing_engine.py`: Consolidate with pricing engine
- `src/multidimensional_processes.py`: Migrate to processes package
- `src/multidimensional_solver.py`: Consolidate with solvers package
- `src/option_pricer.py`: Update to use new unified components
- `src/options.py`: Consolidate with pricing/instruments/options.py
- `src/pde_pricer.py`: Update to use new architecture
- `src/pde_solver.py`: Consolidate with solvers package
- `src/pricing_engine.py`: Integrate with pricing/engines/
- `src/spatial_operator.py`: Update to work with new solver system
- `src/time_steppers.py`: Consolidate with solvers package
- `src/unified_processes_deprecated.py`: Remove after migration
- `src/validation.py`: Enhance with comprehensive validation
- `src/plotting/`: Refactor into more cohesive visualization system
- `src/pricing/`: Reorganize instruments and engines
- `src/processes/`: Enhance organization and extensibility
- `src/risk/`: Expand with comprehensive risk measures
- `src/solvers/`: Consolidate all solver implementations
- `src/utils/`: Organize utilities into logical groups

## Testing Strategy
1. Run existing test suite before each refactor
2. Update tests to work with refactored components
3. Add new tests for enhanced functionality
4. Verify backward compatibility is maintained
5. Test all examples and API endpoints
6. Run integration tests for multi-dimensional pricing

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All existing tests pass
2. New unified architecture is fully functional
3. Backward compatibility is maintained
4. Code duplication is eliminated
5. Documentation is updated
6. Examples work with new architecture
7. API endpoints function correctly

## Dependencies
1. Current test suite must be stable
2. No ongoing changes to core components
3. Access to complete codebase

## Estimated Complexity
HIGH - This is a comprehensive refactoring that touches most components of the system. It requires careful planning and incremental implementation to avoid breaking existing functionality.

## Potential Issues
1. Breaking changes to existing API
2. Difficulty maintaining backward compatibility
3. Complex interdependencies between components
4. Risk of introducing bugs during migration
5. Need to update extensive documentation and examples
