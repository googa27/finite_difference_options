# FastAPI 1D Models Implementation - COMPLETED

## Plan Creation Date
2025-08-23 20:15:00

## Task Description
Implement a new FastAPI endpoint for 1D models that returns full 2D grids (time and space) for option prices and Greeks, enabling frontend visualization similar to the Streamlit app.

## Detailed Requirements
1. Create a new endpoint that accepts model parameters and returns full 2D grids
2. Return both prices and Greeks as 2D arrays
3. Maintain compatibility with existing endpoints
4. Use proper data validation and error handling
5. Implement efficient data transfer (consider JSON vs other formats)

## Implementation Approach
1. Create new Pydantic models for the enhanced response
2. Implement new endpoint in api/main.py
3. Ensure proper handling of 1D models
4. Add validation and error handling
5. Test with sample requests

## Files Modified
- `api/main.py`: Added new endpoint and models

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Response Model
Added `FullPDEResponse` model that returns:
- `s`: List of asset price grid points
- `t`: List of time grid points  
- `prices`: 2D list of option prices (time x asset price)
- `delta`: 2D list of Delta values
- `gamma`: 2D list of Gamma values
- `theta`: 2D list of Theta values

### 2. New Endpoint
Implemented `/pde_solution` endpoint that:
- Accepts the same parameters as existing endpoints
- Returns full 2D grids for visualization
- Computes prices and Greeks using the existing OptionPricer
- Formats results for easy frontend consumption

### 3. Testing
Verified functionality through:
- Manual endpoint testing with curl
- Comparison with existing endpoints
- Validation of returned data structures

## Testing Strategy
1. Test endpoint with various model parameters
2. Verify returned grids are correctly formatted
3. Ensure error handling works properly
4. Test performance with different grid sizes

## Acceptance Criteria - ACHIEVED
1. ✅ New endpoint returns 2D grids for prices and Greeks
2. ✅ Endpoint handles all 1D model types
3. ✅ Proper validation and error handling
4. ✅ Response format compatible with frontend plotting
5. ✅ Performance acceptable for typical grid sizes

## Dependencies
None - this was a standalone enhancement

## Estimated Complexity
MEDIUM - Required understanding of existing structure and extending appropriately

## Potential Issues Addressed
1. ✅ Data serialization performance with large grids (JSON works well for moderate sizes)
2. ✅ Memory usage with large grids (within expected limits)
3. ✅ Compatibility with existing data structures (maintained backward compatibility)
4. ✅ Proper handling of different 1D model types (uses existing OptionPricer)

## Implementation Results

### New Endpoint
- **URL**: `/pde_solution`
- **Method**: POST
- **Input**: `OptionRequest` (same as existing endpoints)
- **Output**: `FullPDEResponse` with complete 2D grids

### Example Usage
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/pde_solution" \\
  -H "accept: application/json" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"option_type":"Call","strike":100.0,"maturity":1.0,"rate":0.05,"sigma":0.2,"s_max":200.0,"s_steps":10,"t_steps":5}'
```

### Response Format
Returns a JSON object with:
- `s`: Asset price grid points
- `t`: Time grid points
- `prices`: 2D array of option prices
- `delta`: 2D array of Delta values
- `gamma`: 2D array of Gamma values
- `theta`: 2D array of Theta values

### Backend Integration
The new endpoint leverages the existing:
- `OptionPricer.compute_grid()` method with `return_greeks=True`
- `GeometricBrownianMotion` model
- European option instruments
- Finite difference Greeks calculator

This provides a complete solution that's ready for frontend visualization while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing endpoints.
