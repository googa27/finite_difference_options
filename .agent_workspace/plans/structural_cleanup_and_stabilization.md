# Structural Cleanup and Stabilization Plan

## Task Description
Perform structural cleanup and stabilization of the codebase after major refactoring. This involves removing obsolete files, integrating relevant refactor test files, fixing test collection errors, and ensuring overall codebase health.

## Detailed Requirements
1. Remove obsolete standalone Python files in the project root.
2. Integrate functionality from refactor test files (`test_*_refactor.py`) into the main test suite or remove them if no longer relevant.
3. Fix test collection errors related to missing `multidimensional_*` modules.
4. Ensure all tests pass or have a clear understanding of failures.
5. Commit changes frequently with descriptive messages.

## Implementation Approach
1. Identify and remove obsolete standalone Python files.
2. Analyze refactor test files to determine if their functionality is already covered or needs integration.
3. Investigate and resolve test collection errors.
4. Run the test suite to verify the state after each change.
5. Commit changes with clear messages.

## Files to Modify
- `test_comprehensive_refactored_structure.py`, `test_greeks_refactor.py`, `test_payoff_refactor.py`, `test_refactored_structure.py`, `test_solver_refactor.py`, `debug_test.py` (potential removal).
- Test files in `tests/test_multidimensional/` (investigate import errors).
- Potentially `src/` files if modules were moved or renamed.

## Testing Strategy
1. Run `pytest --collect-only` to see the test suite before and after changes.
2. Run `pytest` to execute tests after each set of changes.
3. Pay special attention to errors related to missing modules.
4. Ensure that existing functionality is not broken by cleanup.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Obsolete standalone Python files are removed.
- Relevant refactor test functionality is integrated or confirmed as redundant.
- Test collection errors are resolved.
- The test suite runs without import errors (though individual tests may still fail for other reasons).
- All changes are committed with descriptive messages.

## Dependencies
- None.

## Estimated Complexity
MEDIUM - Requires understanding of the refactoring changes and how they affect the test suite.

## Potential Issues
- Removing files might inadvertently remove important functionality if not carefully analyzed.
- Integration of refactor tests might require modifying existing tests or source code.
- The test collection errors might indicate deeper issues with module organization that need to be addressed.
